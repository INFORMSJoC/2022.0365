The two publically available real-world retail datasets from Walmart used in this study are available at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-accuracy and https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/walmart-recruiting-sales-in-stormy-weather/data. The MAT-files, i.e., M5.mat and Walmart 2024.mat, were used in the MATLAB and contain the transformed data described as high-dimensional tensors. Note that, due to the large volume of the MAT-file for the first, i.e., M5, dataset, the data subset about the first 100 products from the 3049 products was extracted to facilitate uploading, and this data subset can be found in the master directory.
