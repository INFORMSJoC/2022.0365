The two publically available real-world retail datasets from Walmart used in this study are available at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/m5-forecasting-accuracy and https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/walmart-recruiting-sales-in-stormy-weather/data. The MAT-files were used in the MATLAB and contain the transformed data described as high-dimensional tensors. Note that, due to the large volume of the MAT-file for the first dataset, i.e., M5-competition, the data subset about the first 100 products from the 3429 products was extracted to facilitate uploading.
